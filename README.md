# Card Flipper

Build out a virtual trading card app using jQuery! The trading cards can be of whatever you want - players from your favorite sports, characters from your favorite movies, puppies, etc. 

## Introduction

Today, you'll be building out a web app for viewing virtual trading cards. You'll be able to flip the cards over by clicking on them using jQuery!

## Instructions
+ Look in the `index.html` file. There's a `<div>` with the class of `card` which acts as a container. 
+ Add text and images to the front and back of the cards - these are identified by `<figure>` elements and classes. 
+ In the `card.js` file (`public/javascripts/card.js`), add a jQuery event handler for clicking the div with class of `card`. 
+ If the card is on the front, it should add the class of "flipped". If it's on the back, it should remove that class. See the hints below. 

## Bonus
Add multiple cards to the page. Make sure that only the card you click on flips over! 

## Double Bonus
Add styling and make it look pretty!
